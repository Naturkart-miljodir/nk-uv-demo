## Getting Started

The **nk-uv-demo** package provides a python project built with uv. You can install this package from [Test PyPI](https://test.pypi.org/project/nk-uv-demo/) or pull the containerized version from [GHCR](https://github.com/naturkart-miljodir/nk-uv-demo/pkgs/container/nk-uv-demo).

### Installation

> [!NOTE]
> This package is published to Test PyPI for demonstration purposes. Test PyPI is a testing environment for package deployment without affecting the official PyPI index. If you're using this package in production, ensure it's published to the official PyPI index.

Install the package from Test PyPI:

```bash
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ nk-uv-demo
```

```python
import nk_uv_demo
nk_uv_demo.main()
# > Hello from nk-uv-demo!
# > Version: x.x.x
```

Or pull and run the container:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/naturkart-miljodir/nk-uv-demo:latest

docker run --rm ghcr.io/naturkart-miljodir/nk-uv-demo:latest
# > Hello from nk-uv-demo!
# > Version: x.x.x
```

## Development

> [!TIP]
> **Recommended Setup:** Use [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) or [VS Code Devcontainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) for a consistent environment. Alternative option is to install the project locally using uv.

The following steps configure your development environment using VS Code Dev Containers. For local setup without containers, refer to the [setup guide](./docs/setup-guide.md) in the documentation.


### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [VS Code Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) extension


### Setup

1. **Open the project**: Clone and open the project folder in VS Code or use [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces).

2. **Start the devcontainer**: When prompted, reopen the folder in the Devcontainer. If not prompted, manually trigger it via the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`) and select "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container".

3. **Automatic setup**: The devcontainer automatically:
   - Configures VS Code with recommended settings and extensions per [devcontainer.json](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json)
   - Installs development tools: [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/), [Task](https://taskfile.dev/installation/)
   - Sets up the Python environment with dependencies in `.venv` via `task dev-setup`, which runs `uv sync --dev` and executes code quality checks and test coverage

4. **Test the installation with Task commands**:


   Task is used to automate common development tasks *(see [Taskfile.yml](Taskfile.yml))*.

   ```bash
   # Test the package
   task run
   # or
   uv run nk-uv-demo

   # Run quality checks
   task check

   # Run local CI workflow
   task ci-local

   # Clean up
   task clean
   ```

5. **Test the notebook**: Open `notebooks/demo.ipynb` and select the `.venv` kernel. If you have problems activating the `.venv` refer to the [setup guide](./docs/setup-guide.md).


6. **Configure the GitHub Repository**: If you fork this repository or use it to create a new repository from scratch, you'll need to configure your GitHub repository to connect with **Test PyPI**, **Safety** and **Code Coverage**. Also, verify that your **security scans** are properly set up. See the **GitHub Repository Configuration** section in the [setup guide](./docs/setup-guide.md) for instructions.

## Development Workflow

1. **Setup**:
- Follow the setup instructions above or refer to the [Installation Guide](docs/installation.md).
   - Follow the demo walkthrough in the [Quick Start Guide](docs/demo-quickstart.md)


2. **Develop**:
    - Create a branch for your feature or bug fix: `feat/<name>` or `fix/<name>`.
    - Make your changes. For example develop package functions in `src/` or add notebooks to `notebooks/`.
    - Ensure code meets the quality standards by running `task check`.
    - Ensure tests are written for new features and pass `task test`.

3. **Integrate**:
    - Check that all CI tests pass locally with `task ci-local`.
    - Push your branch to GitHub.
    - Create a pull request against the `main` branch.
    - Await review and merge; your branch will be automatically deleted after merging.

4. **Deploy**:
    - Create a git tag for releases (e.g., `v0.0.1`) using `task tag`.
    - Create a PR from `release/<version>` to `main` to deploy the new release.
    - Once merged to `main`, the CD workflows are triggered:
        - CD Python automatically builds and publishes the package to Test PyPI.
- CD Docker builds and pushes the container image to GitHub Container Registry.


5. **Clean up**:
   - Clean up dev files and artifacts with `task clean`.
   - Clean up local git:
        - enable pruning: `git config --global fetch.prune true`
        - delete merged branch locally: `git branch -d <branch-name>`

### Code Quality Standards

Follow PEP8, use type hints, and include docstrings in reStructuredText format. All quality checks are automated through Task commands, pre-commit hooks and CI workflows.

See the [Code Quality and Security Standards](./docs/code-and-security-standards.md) guide to see which rules are enforced in this repo.

### GHA Workflows

The repository includes automated workflows for code quality, security, and deployment:

| Workflow | Trigger | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **CI Python** | `push`, `pull_request` to `main` | Code quality checks, testing, coverage |
| **CD Python** | `push` to `main` with version tags | Package deployment to Test PyPI |
| **CD Docker** | `push` to `main` with version tags | Container deployment to GitHub Registry |
| **Safety Scan** | `push`, `pull_request`, `schedule` | Python dependency vulnerability scanning |
| **CodeQL Analysis** | `push`, `pull_request`, `schedule` | Code security analysis |
| **Zizmor Security** | `push`, `pull_request` | GHA workflow security |

The demo workflows can be customized or removed based on your specific project requirements. At minimum, I recommend including the **CI Python** workflow for code quality and testing, as well as the Security workflows: **CodeQL**, **Safety**, and **Zizmor**.

### Local Development Commands

Use these commands for local development and testing:

```bash
# Setup and quality checks
task install          # Install dependencies and setup environment
task check            # Run all quality checks
task ci-local         # Simulate CI pipeline locally

# Testing and running
task test             # Run test suite
task run              # Run the demo package
task run-docker       # Run in Docker container


# Code formatting and security
task format           # Format code with ruff
task security         # Run security scans

# Build and release
task build            # Build Python package
task tag              # Prepare a new release (create git tag)
```

For more commands see: [Command Cheatsheet](./docs/command-cheatsheet.md)


### Branch Protection

The `main` branch is protected with the following rules:

- Require pull request reviews before merging
- Require status checks to pass before merging
- Require branches to be up to date before merging
